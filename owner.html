        Hi! I’m Drea, the 20-year-old baker behind Drea’s Place, and I’ve been in love with the kitchen since I could reach the counter—literally. I started baking at just five years old, and I never really stopped. Watching Tiana from The Princess and the Frog as a little girl lit a fire in me—her drive, her dream, her love for food—it all spoke to my heart. That same spark turned into something real when I was fourteen, and I officially launched Drea’s Place. It started with homemade treats for family and friends, but thanks to the love and encouragement of my family and mentors, I decided to take that passion and build something bigger.

        Drea’s Place is more than just a bakery—it’s a space filled with love, creativity, and a whole lot of sugar and soul. Every cupcake, cookie, and treat I make is crafted with care, inspired by memories, dreams, and a desire to bring joy to others through food. This business is a piece of me—something I’ve poured my heart into from a young age—and I’m so excited to keep growing it while honoring the little girl who once dreamed in sprinkles and frosting. Thanks for stopping by and supporting a dream in progress!
